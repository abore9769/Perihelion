## Overview

Perihelion lets a user declare a simple **intent** — _"I want X amount of asset Y
on Stellar"_ — and a decentralized network of **solvers** competes to fulfill it,
atomically and at the best available rate. No manual bridging steps, no token
wrapping, no fragile multi-transaction dance.

It is built natively on [Soroban](https://soroban.stellar.org), Stellar's smart
contract platform, and is designed for the way Stellar actually works: fast
finality, low fees, and a growing ecosystem of real-world assets that need
seamless liquidity connections to the rest of the blockchain world.

The model is proven on Ethereum — it is the same architecture behind
[UniswapX](https://uniswap.org) and [CoW Protocol](https://cow.fi) — but it has
been largely absent from Stellar. Perihelion brings it to Soroban and uses it to
solve Stellar's single most important growth bottleneck: **inbound liquidity.**

## Why Perihelion

### The problem

Stellar has become critical financial infrastructure — over **\$2B in tokenized
real-world assets**, institutional-grade stablecoins (USDC, EURC, YLDS, MGUSD),
and payment rails used by MoneyGram, Franklin Templeton, and PayPal.

But moving assets _onto_ Stellar from Ethereum, Base, or any other major chain
still requires one of:

- **Centralized exchanges** — custodial, KYC-gated, slow withdrawals.
- **Manual DEX hops** — multiple transactions, MEV exposure, poor rates.
- **Lock-and-mint bridges** — custodial wrapper assets and a long history of
  catastrophic exploits.

Capital that should be flowing into Stellar's DeFi, lending markets, and RWA
platforms sits on other chains because the on-ramp is too hard.

### The solution

Perihelion replaces all of that with a single signed message. The user never
touches a wrapper asset, never executes a multi-step bridge, and never takes
custodial risk. Either they receive at least the amount they asked for on
Stellar, or they are refunded in full on the source chain. There is no state in
which a user loses funds mid-bridge.

## Features

- 🎯 **Intent-based UX** — users sign _what they want_, not _how to get it_.
- ⚡ **Atomic settlement** — fill both legs or refund; no partial states.
- 🤝 **Solver competition** — an open network races to give users the best rate,
  instead of a single privileged operator.
- 🔓 **Permissionless** — anyone can run a solver, a relayer, or a keeper. No
  allowlist gates liveness, and the refund path needs no privileged actor.
- 🛰️ **LayerZero-secured messaging** — verified cross-chain delivery with a
  multi-DVN trust model, plus a roadmap to ZK state proofs (Protocol 24).
- 🪙 **Canonical assets** — users receive real Stellar assets sourced from solver
  liquidity, never a synthetic wrapper.
- 🧱 **Built for contributors** — a clean monorepo with scoped, skill-tagged
  issues for [Drips Wave](https://communityfund.stellar.org) sprint cycles.

## How It Works

Perihelion uses an **intent + solver** architecture:

1. **The user declares an intent.** They sign a structured message off-chain
   specifying the asset and amount to receive on Stellar, the asset and chain to
   spend from, a deadline, and a slippage floor. No transaction, no gas yet.
2. **Solvers compete to fill it.** A decentralized network of solvers monitors
   the intent mempool and races to fill profitable orders. The winner earns the
   spread between what the user offered and what the solver sourced.
3. **Atomic settlement.** The user's funds are locked in the source-chain escrow
   against a cryptographic commitment; the solver fronts liquidity on Stellar;
   the escrow releases the locked funds to the solver once settlement is verified
   over LayerZero. If the deadline passes without a fill, the user is refunded.
4. **Trust-minimized messaging.** Cross-chain messages are carried by
   [LayerZero](https://layerzero.network) with an independent multi-DVN verifier
   set, and — on the roadmap — Stellar's native ZK proof support (Protocol 24)
   for the most sensitive path.

## Architecture

### Settlement flow

```

        ▼
Intent Mempool (open, permissionless)

         ┌──────────┴──────────┐
         ▼                     ▼

         └──── LayerZero ──────┘
              Message Relay

                    ▼
         User receives assets
         on Stellar ✓
```

### The intent hash

A single value — the EIP-712 `intent_hash` — ties every leg together. It is:

- the commitment the EVM escrow locks the user's funds against,
- the identifier carried in every LayerZero message,
- and the key the Soroban settlement contract uses for replay protection.

The hash is computed identically by the SDK (`hashIntent`) and the EVM escrow
(`hashIntent`), so every component keys off one stable identifier. The full
design — storage layout, state machine, message formats, threat model, and
phased rollout — is in the
**[Technical Architecture Specification](./docs/TECHNICAL-ARCHITECTURE.md)**.

## Repository Layout

| Path         | Description                                                         |

This is an [npm workspaces](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/using-npm/workspaces)
monorepo for the TypeScript packages (`sdk`, `solver`, `relayer`), a Cargo
workspace for the Soroban contracts, and a Foundry project for the EVM contracts.

| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Phase 1** | Guarded mainnet-beta: one corridor, allowlisted solvers, value caps | DVN set + team multisig (timelocked)     |
| **Phase 2** | Multi-route, permissionless solvers & relayers               | DVN set only (no per-operator trust)     |
| **Phase 3** | ZK state-proof verification (BN254 / Protocol 24), on-chain governance | Proof-system soundness                   |

Each phase has measurable acceptance criteria and an external **audit gate**
before the next begins. See the
[phased rollout](./docs/TECHNICAL-ARCHITECTURE.md#8-phased-rollout) for details.

## Project Status

Perihelion is in **active early development**. Current focus: the Soroban
settlement contract and the intent specification.

> ⚠️ **The interfaces and on-chain formats described here are not yet stable, are
> unaudited, and may change before the first audited release. Do not use in
> production.**

We build in public and welcome contributors at every stage — from architecture
discussions to the first lines of contract code.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome at every level. The project is structured around
clearly scoped, skill-tagged issues designed for
[Drips Wave](https://communityfund.stellar.org) sprint cycles, across four
tracks: **Rust/Soroban**, **Solidity**, **TypeScript**, and **Documentation**.

1. Read the [Contributing Guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md) and the
   [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
2. Browse the [issue taxonomy](./docs/TECHNICAL-ARCHITECTURE.md#9-contribution-guide-for-drips-wave)
   to find work matched to your skills and a Wave cycle.
3. Open or claim an issue, branch, implement with tests, and open a PR.

All PRs run through CI (`npm test`, `cargo test`, `forge test`) and are reviewed
against the protocol's [design invariants](./docs/TECHNICAL-ARCHITECTURE.md#0-design-invariants-read-first).

## Security

Perihelion is unaudited and under active development. If you discover a
vulnerability, **please do not open a public issue** — follow the responsible
disclosure process in [`SECURITY.md`](./SECURITY.md).
